# Recharge: A Mobile Shop

Recharge, built entirely in Python, simulates a mobile shop. Users may log in. signup, view a wide collection of phones, add them to or remove them from their cart, and check out. These interactions affect the stock and other details on the MySQL server on the backend, connected to Python via the mysql-connector package. Alternatively, administrators may also login, and choose to add or remove admins, customers, new phone models, stock, and view the purchase history, and the current capital.
